- Hello, I’m Nikolett Till from Hungary, alias @Destranis. I've been using this username for various projects and collaborations, so I decided to continue so here as well.
-  I’m interested in languages, as well as translating various programs, which are unavailable in my native language; hungarian of course. I've been trying to learn programming as well, but I'm more of a spoken language oriented person. I love music: doing it myself, and listening as well, there's no difference.
- I’m currently learning linguistics and translation at university. My specialization is russian-hungarian.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on any kind of projects, if they are able to be translated.
